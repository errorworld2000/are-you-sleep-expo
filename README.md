# Are You Sleeping? - Expo

"Are You Sleeping?" is a lightweight social app designed to enhance connections between close friends or couples. Users can easily set and view each other's "sleep status" (e.g., "awake" or "asleep") and can send fun "poke" reminders as a lighthearted way to say goodnight or remind someone to get some rest.
